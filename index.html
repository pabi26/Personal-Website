                    Growing up, I was very active and played a lot of sports such as soccer, baseball,
                    basketball, hockey, football, etc... Too many to name LOL. I am still pshyical
                    active till this day but I now spend most of my time at the gym. My main hobbies

                    I attended high school at West Humber and later York University where I recieved 
                    an Bachelors degree in Law and Society. Unfortunately, I did not want to pursue an
                    career in that feild because I found it to be boring and unchallenging. During
                    university, I also stuidied Economics as well as the financial markets where I
                    learned a great deal of information.

                    I am now studying to become an FrontEnd developer and eventually a FullStack 
                    developer. I have been studying for about 6 months now but only just began 
                    making projects on VSC where as previously, I was only making projects on 
                    the Scrimba platform.

                    My goals in life are pretty simple, I want to travel the wolrd and experience the
                    different cultures the world has to offer. I want to learn as much as I possibly
                    can during the time I have left on this earth. I want to be able to run 10 miles
                    without stopping, I can barely do half a mile at the atm so I have a long way
                    to go.

                <h3>
                    My main goals however are to retire my parents ASAP, while working in a career
                    that will allow me to expand my horison and challenage myself daily. As well as
                    help as many people as I can in whatever way possible.
